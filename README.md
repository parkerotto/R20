# R20
Official Github for the Roaring '20s Chicago Project at the University of Chicago in partnership with the Chicago Studies Program and Library Center for Digital Scholarship.

This project seeks to create a vector building footprint layer for the entier city of Chicago using a computational workflow in Python with post-processing in QGIS.  You can find the original Python code and QGIS post-processing model builder script in this repository.  

So far, we have completed digitization of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps for the Hyde Park and Woodlawn community areas.  A preliminary visualization of our data can be found at https://parkerotto.github.io/Final/.  

Also in the works is a paper by Parker Otto and Yue Lin from the University of Chicago: "The Roaring â€˜20s Project: Mapping Pre-Renewal Built Environments in Chicago from Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps Using a Computational Workflow" which is expected to be completed in the coming months.
